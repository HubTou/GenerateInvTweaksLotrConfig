About GenerateInvTweaksLotrConfig
=================================
A small utility to generate an Inventory Tweaks Minecraft mod configuration file supporting the Lord of the Rings Minecraft Mod items.


Installation
============
No need to install this software. Run it once from where you unpacked it.


Usage
=====
Type "CategorizeLotrData.sh", then "InsertLotrDataInInvTweaksTree.sh".
Get the result in "InvTweaksTree-lotr.txt".

The list of LOTR mod items can be produced with another of my Minecraft utilities:
"ShowLocalMinecraftIds.sh -m lotr -i | cut -d";" -f3 > lotr244.items" (assuming the level.dat of your world is in the same directory)


Caveats
=======
Developed and tested only on FreeBSD 10.1.
